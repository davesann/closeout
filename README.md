# Closeout - a state binding library

## Demo Site

http://closeout-demo.herokuapp.com/

If it's slow to start - it probably means that the instance has to boot up.


## Usage

To use in you clojurescript projects you just have to include the dependency in 
your project.clj

* clojars [closeout "0.1.0"]

use your preferred method for cljs compilation - provided it picks up jars 
in your project lib.


## Documentation 

Good documentation is pending.

For now please see the demo application code.
In particular - the applications themselves are defined in the templates 
files.

https://github.com/davesann/closeout-demo-cljs

## if you want to build and hack this

You will need https://github.com/davesann/cljs-watch to work with the generic code.

This is necessary so that I can produce generic code and 
still jar the files for distribution
